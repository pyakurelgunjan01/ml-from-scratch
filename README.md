# Linear Regression From Scratch (No Libraries)

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression completely from scratch** using only pure Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). No numpy, pandas, sklearn, or any machine learning libraries are used.

## 🔥 Project Highlights
- Written using only Python basics
- OOP-based ML model
- Manual implementation of:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Covariance
  - Slope (m)
  - Intercept (c)
  - Prediction function
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Perfect beginner project for understanding ML mathematically

## 📁 Files in this project
- `regression.py` – main ML model implementation
- `README.md` – project documentation

## 📊 Formula Used
The line equation:

y = mx + c

Where:
- **m** = slope  
- **c** = intercept

## ▶️ How to Run
Run the project using:


## 📈 Example Output
The program prints:
- Slope  
- Intercept  
- Prediction for a sample input  
- MSE error value  

## 📚 Learnings
By doing this project, you understand:
- How ML works internally
- How to build your own ML model
- Mathematics behind linear regression
- Python OOP for machine learning
